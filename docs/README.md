## 🛠️ Implementation Tips

### Before You Start
1. **Backup your current implementation**
   ```bash
   git add -A && git commit -m "backup: current implementation"
   ```

2. **Update dependencies** (optional but recommended)
   ```bash
   npm update @builder.io/qwik @builder.io/qwik-city
   ```

3. **Set up development environment**
   - Install recommended VS Code extensions
   - Configure ESLint and Prettier
   - Set up testing framework

### During Implementation
1. **Implement incrementally** - Don't try to implement everything at once
2. **Test thoroughly** - Each change should be tested before moving to the next
3. **Monitor performance** - Use Lighthouse CI to track improvements
4. **Document changes** - Keep track of what you've implemented

### After Implementation
1. **Run performance audits**
2. **Update documentation**
3. **Share improvements with community**
4. **Plan future enhancements**
